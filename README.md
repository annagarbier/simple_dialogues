Simple dialogues converted into ridiculously detailed phonetic descriptions.

In this directory:

1. `consonants.csv` - phoneme-to-articulatory description mappings for consonants
1. `vowels.csv` - phoneme-to-articulatory description mappings for vowels
1. `simple_dialogues_core.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook with a basic implementation of text-to-articulatory descriptions
