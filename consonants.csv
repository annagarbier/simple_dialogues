DH,"<PRO> raises the tip of <PRO_POS> tongue so that it touches the bottom edge of <PRO_POS> top, front teeth. <PRO> releases air through <PRO_POS> mouth, creating slight vibrations between <PRO_POS> tongue and teeth. As <PRO> does so, <PRO> tightens <PRO_POS> vocal folds so they also vibrate."
F,"<PRO> raises <PRO_POS> lower lip so that it touches the bottom edge of <PRO_POS> top, front teeth. <PRO> releases air through <PRO_POS> mouth, creating slight vibrations between <PRO_POS> bottom lip and teeth."
HH,"<PRO> partially constricts <PRO_POS> glottis. While keeping <PRO_POS> vocal folds relaxed, <PRO> pushes air through this partial constriction."
SH,"<PRO> raises the tip of <PRO_POS> tongue so that it touches the roof of <PRO_POS> mouth just behind <PRO_POS> gum line. <PRO> releases air through <PRO_POS> mouth, creating slight vibrations between <PRO_POS> tongue and the roof of <PRO_POS> mouth."
TH,"<PRO> raises the tip of <PRO_POS> tongue so that it touches the bottom edge of <PRO_POS> top, front teeth. <PRO> releases air through <PRO_POS> mouth, creating slight vibrations between <PRO_POS> tongue and teeth."
V,"<PRO> raises <PRO_POS> lower lip so that it touches the bottom edge of <PRO_POS> top, front teeth. <PRO> releases air through <PRO_POS> mouth, creating slight vibrations between <PRO_POS> bottom lip and teeth."
Z,"<PRO> raises the tip of <PRO_POS> tongue against <PRO_POS> gum line, just behind <PRO_POS> top teeth. With <PRO_POS> vocal folds tensed, <PRO> releases air through <PRO_POS> mouth, creating slight vibrations between <PRO_POS> tongue and gum line."
ZH,"<PRO> raises the tip of <PRO_POS> tongue so that it touches the roof of <PRO_POS> mouth just behind <PRO_POS> gum line. With <PRO_POS> vocal folds tensed, <PRO> releases air through <PRO_POS> mouth, creating slight vibrations between <PRO_POS> tongue and the roof of <PRO_POS> mouth."
S,"<PRO> raises the tip of <PRO_POS> tongue against <PRO_POS> gum line, just behind <PRO_POS> top teeth. <PRO> releases air through <PRO_POS> mouth, creating slight vibrations between <PRO_POS> tongue and gum line."
B,"<PRO> closes <PRO_POS> lips together. <PRO> pushes a little air into <PRO_POS> mouth, so that air pressure builds behind <PRO_POS> lips. With <PRO_POS> vocal folds tensed, <PRO> quickly parts <PRO_POS> lips, releasing the air pressure in a short burst."
D,"<PRO> touches the tip of <PRO_POS> tongue to the roof of <PRO_POS> mouth at <PRO_POS> gum line, just behind <PRO_POS> top teeth. <PRO> creates a tight constriction and allows air pressure to build inside <PRO_POS> mouth. <PRO> quickly lowers <PRO_POS> tongue, releasing the air pressure in a short burst. As <PRO> does so, <PRO> keeps <PRO_POS> vocal folds tense."
G,"<PRO> raises the back of <PRO_POS> tongue upwards so that it touches the soft back part of the roof of <PRO_POS> mouth, creating a tight constriction. <PRO> allows air pressure to build, then quickly releases the pressure by lowering the back of <PRO_POS> tongue. As <PRO> does so, <PRO> keeps <PRO_POS> vocal folds tensed."
K,"<PRO> raises the back of <PRO_POS> tongue upwards so that it touches the soft back part of the roof of <PRO_POS> mouth, creating a tight constriction. <PRO> allows air pressure to build, then quickly releases the pressure by lowering the back of <PRO_POS> tongue."
P,"<PRO> closes <PRO_POS> lips together. <PRO> pushes a little air into <PRO_POS> mouth, so that air pressure builds behind <PRO_POS> lips. <PRO> quickly parts <PRO_POS> lips, releasing the air pressure in a short burst."
T,"<PRO> touches the tip of <PRO_POS> tongue to the roof of <PRO_POS> mouth at <PRO_POS> gum line, just behind <PRO_POS> top teeth. <PRO> creates a tight constriction and allows air pressure to build inside <PRO_POS> mouth. <PRO> quickly lowers <PRO_POS> tongue, releasing the air pressure in a short burst."
CH,"<PRO> touches the tip of <PRO_POS> tongue to the roof of <PRO_POS> mouth at <PRO_POS> gum line, just behind <PRO_POS> top teeth. <PRO> creates a tight constriction and allows air pressure to build inside <PRO_POS> mouth. <PRO> quickly lowers <PRO_POS> tongue as <PRO> releases air, keeping a slight constriction so that that <PRO_POS> tongue continues to vibrate against the roof of <PRO_POS> mouth."
JH,"<PRO> touches the tip of <PRO_POS> tongue to the roof of <PRO_POS> mouth at <PRO_POS> gum line, just behind <PRO_POS> top teeth. <PRO> creates a tight constriction and allows air pressure to build inside <PRO_POS> mouth. <PRO> quickly lowers <PRO_POS> tongue as <PRO> releases air, keeping a slight constriction so that that <PRO_POS> tongue continues to vibrate against the roof of <PRO_POS> mouth. As <PRO> does this, <PRO> keeps <PRO_POS> vocal folds tense."
M,"<PRO> touches <PRO_POS> lips together. With <PRO_POS> vocal folds tensed, <PRO> releases air through <PRO_POS> nasal cavity."
N,"<PRO> touches the tip of <PRO_POS> tongue to the roof of <PRO_POS> mouth at <PRO_POS> gum line, just behind <PRO_POS> top teeth. With <PRO_POS> vocal folds tensed, <PRO> releases air through <PRO_POS> nasal cavity."
NG,"<PRO> raises the back of <PRO_POS> tongue upwards so that it touches the soft back part of the roof of <PRO_POS> mouth. With <PRO_POS> vocal folds tense, <PRO> releases air through <PRO_POS> nasal cavity."
L,"<PRO> raises the tip of <PRO_POS> tongue against <PRO_POS> gum line, just behind <PRO_POS> top teeth. Keeping <PRO_POS> tongue firmly in this position, <PRO> tenses <PRO_POS> vocal folds and releases air so that the air moves across the sides of <PRO_POS> tongue."
R,"<PRO> raises the blade of <PRO_POS> tongue towards <PRO_POS> gum line, just behind <PRO_POS> top teeth, without actually touching the roof of <PRO_POS> mouth. With <PRO_POS> vocal folds tensed, <PRO> releases air through <PRO_POS> unconstricted mouth."
W,"<PRO> rounds <PRO_POS> lips so that they create a small opening. With <PRO_POS> lips in this position, <PRO> raises the back of <PRO_POS> tongue towards the back of the roof of <PRO_POS> mouth. <PRO> keeps a little space between <PRO_POS> tongue and the roof of <PRO_POS> mouth. <PRO> releases air through <PRO_POS> mouth. As <PRO> does so, <PRO> keeps <PRO_POS> vocal folds tense."
Y,"<PRO> raises the back of <PRO_POS> tongue towards the hard part of the roof of <PRO_POS> mouth, neither too far forward nor too far back. <PRO> keeps some space between <PRO_POS> tongue and the roof of <PRO_POS> mouth. With <PRO_POS> vocal folds tensed, <PRO> releases air through <PRO_POS> mouth."
